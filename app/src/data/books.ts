    author: 'J. Christopher Frazer',
    description:
      "Nightmares haunt Dalwan before he ever understands their meaning-visions of searching eyes, clawed shadows, and a rising power beneath the mountains. When the ancient sword Fallonrod is awakened, its luminous veins of green, blue, and white fire call to him with a purpose he never sought and a destiny he never desired. Forged in the deep-earth fire of ages past, Fallonrod is no ordinary weapon. It is a force of balance-between creation and destruction, life and ruin-and it has chosen Dalwan as its bearer. But with the sword's power comes the attention of darker forces: the spreading corruption of Malmoria, the rising tensions within the kingdom, and the earth-power that stirs beneath the Magnon Mountains. Drawn into political conflict, hidden realms, and long-buried magic, Dalwan must confront the truth of his visions and the shadow that has followed him since childhood. The fate of the realm may depend on a boy still learning what it means to stand, to fight, and to wield a power he barely understands. A sweeping tale of prophecy, magic, and courage, Dalwan and the Sword Fallonrod blends classic high-fantasy storytelling with an intimate coming-of-age journey-perfect for readers who love Brandon Sanderson, Robert Jordan, and timeless epic adventures.",
