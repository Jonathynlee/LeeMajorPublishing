    title: 'Dalwan and the Sword Fallonrod',
    author: 'J. Christopher Frazer',
    description:
      `
      For centuries, the legendary sword Fallonrod has lain fused into stone, its last wielder, Maylor of Castle Crest, dead a hundred years and its power feared by kings, mages, and rival races alike. Some claim its magic is elven, others dwarven, but all agree on one truth: any who try to claim Fallonrod perish.

Now, as ancient earthpower rises again, kingdoms whisper of war and rulers hunt for a mythical “powermaster” capable of controlling the blade that could change the fate of nations.

In the midst of this rising storm stands Dalwan, a 15-year-old boy whose magic awakened far too early, and far too powerfully. Haunted by visions, coveted by kings, and feared for what he might become, Dalwan is taken under the wing of his great uncle Shaylan. But training may not be enough.

If Fallonrod can be freed, who will survive touching it?
A tyrant seeking dominion?
A hero strong enough to save the kingdoms?
Or the boy who never asked for any of this?

As prophecy, power, and fear close in, one question remains:
Is Dalwan destined to claim the greatest weapon ever forged… or to be destroyed by it?`
